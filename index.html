          <p class="bio">
            The year was 1994, the night was June 13th. Curtis and Patricia
            Martin were celebrating their 15th wedding anniversary, and little
            did they know nine months later they were going to have a "Happy
            Little Accident" and end up with a third child. And I've been just
            as lucky ever since! My luck was ever so present in the first grade
            when six cases of tonsilitus left me hospitalized. Oh! And that time
            I was bit by a shark! I continue to press my luck today by trying to
            learn code in just three short months. Now don't get me wrong, I
            haven't always been able to rely on so-called "Lady Luck". She
            wasn't there for me when I won the state championship backstroke
            race when I was twelve. Nor was she there for me when I graduated
            high school five months early with honors. And ESPECIALLY not when I
            needed her most, that fateful night last August when I stayed up all
            night to beat my Castlevania IV high score.
